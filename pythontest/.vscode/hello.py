# msg = 10*10

# print(msg)

#simple for loop with break on a case
# for x in fruits:
#     if x == "strawberry":
#         print("Breaking the loop")
#         break
#     print(x)

#basically skips on a case
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#   if x == "banana":3
#     continue
#   print(x)

# for x in range(6): #returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 to 1 less the num (0-5)
#   print(x)

#range(x, y ,z)
# x = start
# y = end
# z = incriment

# else syntax is just 'else:'
# for x in range(6):
#   print(x)
# else:
#   print("Finally finished!")

# for loops cant be empty but u can do a pass to not get an error
for x in range(3):
    pass
